Analyze this using context7

**Cursor**

Thank you for your request! Before proceeding, let me clarify what you mean by "analyze this using context7." 

- If you are asking for an analysis of your code (HTML/CSS) using the Context7 documentation system (for example, to look up best practices, component usage, or CSS/HTML standards), please specify which library, framework, or technology you want to focus on (e.g., CSS3, HTML5, a specific CSS framework, etc.).
- If you want a general review or explanation of your code, I can do that directly as your tutor.

Could you please clarify:
- Are you looking for documentation or best practices for a specific technology (like CSS or HTML) using Context7?
- Or do you want a general analysis and feedback on your code as it is?

Let me know so I can best assist you!
