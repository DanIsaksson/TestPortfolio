#TestPortfolio
I want to use the design principles below for my portfolio site.

# CSS
- grid
- I want to redesign the site to eventually have the nav-menu stuck to the side of the screen as you scroll down.

# HTML
- Simple structure.
- Build upon.


#EXTRAS
- If I get the time, I want to add a simple splash-page.

## Ideas for Tomorrow (HTML/CSS Only)

### Landing Page (`landing-page.html`)
The goal is to create a simple, striking entry point without using JavaScript.

-   **Big, Bold Title:** A large, centered title with your name. You could use the `Pixelify Sans` font to make it stand out.
-   **Catchy Subtitle:** A short phrase under your name like "Aspiring Developer," "Creative Coder," or "Building for the Web."
-   **A Clear "Enter" Button:** A prominent, styled button or link that takes the user to your `portfolio-gallery.html`. You can make it interactive with CSS `:hover` effects (like changing color or growing slightly).
-   **Simple CSS Animation:** You could make the title and button fade in slowly using CSS animations for a nice, subtle effect.

### About Page (`about.html`)
This is where you can tell your story.

-   **Short Bio Section:** A paragraph or two about yourself.
    -   Who are you?
    -   What got you interested in programming?
    -   What are you passionate about learning?
-   **"My Skills" Section:** Since you're learning, you can frame it as "Skills I'm Developing."
    -   Use a simple `<ul>` list or a grid of `<div>`s to list technologies like HTML, CSS, C#, etc.
-   **Contact Info:**
    -   Links to your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles (you can reuse the social icons from your footer).
    -   You can write out your email address (but avoid making it a `mailto:` link to reduce spam).
-   **A Personal Picture:** Maybe add a small, friendly photo of yourself, perhaps with a styled border that matches your site's aesthetic.
